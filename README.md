# SCAM-ALLERT---PLEASE-READ


DEVELOPER NOTE: Stronghands project (ISHND) has been hijacked by one of the members (valter dias ribeiro aka VDR) and this core team dissolved. For everyone's safety, the blockchain has been paused, in order to wait for the outcome of the situation, and the DAO implementation. In the meantime more than U$ 400k has been missing from the official wallets, which Valter had total control. We assume he must explain for the community where the funds has gone. We will start the DAO implementation process, and decisions will be taken by the community. There is no more core team and no one else is by any means authorized to publish any information unless via the official github account (https://github.com/stronghands-official) . I am really sorry for what happened, and I reiterate that your investment is safe while the blockchain is paused. The remaining tokens under team custody will be sent to the DAO control under the custody of the entire community.

PS: NEVER SWAP YOUR COINS TO ANOTHER CONTRACT, YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR MONEY. The contract will be unpaused after the DAO implementation. This is the only official comunication channel, all others are compromised. Wait for the new instructions.
